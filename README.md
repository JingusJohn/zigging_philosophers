# Zigging Philosophers

This is yet another one of my implementations of the dining philosophers synchronization problem as described by my professor in an assignment for Operating Systems. I enjoyed that assignment so much that It's become one of the first things I try in any language suited toward efficiency and multithreading. This time, I'm using Zig. Zig's interoperability with C, easy adoption, and better developer ergonimics have intrigued me to the point where I'm finally ready to take a dive into it. The creator also has some interesting talks about the language.
